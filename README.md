# Password-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a program that generates a random password based on user-selected parameters.

Through this project, I learnt quite a bit about Javascript, concatenating, random, event listeners, and how to ensure a program's logic is as sharp as possible.

## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

To use the program, simply click on the 'Generate Password' button at the center of the page. A series of alerts will now prompt you for your
desired password parameters. 

After having entered these properly, the page will now display your random password in the text field just above the button.
